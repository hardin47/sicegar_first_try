# Summary

Sicegar aims to quantify time intensity data by using sigmoidal and double sigmoidal curves. It fits straight lines, sigmoidal, and double sigmoidal curves on to time vs intensity data. Then all the fits are used to make a decision on which model best describes the data. This method was first developed in the context of single-cell viral growth analysis (for details, see @caglar2018), and the package name stands for "SIngle CEll Growth Analysis in R". Beyond Sicegar's ability to categorize fits, it also provides parameter estimations for each curve which can also provide important information to researchers. @Adams used Sicegar to investigate the onset time of RNA expression in genes in $\textit{E. Coli}$ undergoing stress. They observed limitations in Sicegar's fits, which motivated the improvements proposed in this paper. The primary change is the estimation of an additional parameter, $h_0$, which is the lower asymptote of both the sigmoidal and double sigmoidal curves. It had previously been set equal to 0. Based on thousands of iterations on simulated data, we've concluded that the free estimation of $h_0$ both provides better fits (lower SSE), and more accurate parameter estimations than when $h_0$ is forced to be equal to 0. We've also made some smaller adjustments to the package with respect to how one of the parameters is un-normalized, and adjusting the threshold for an error catch, however these are more technical and less important than the primary change which is the free estimation of $h_0$. The package is designed so that previous work done using Sicegar can be reproduced. As seen in Figure blah blah blah, the argument `use_h0` in the overarching function `fitAndCategorize` allows the user to decide whether to allow the package to estimate $h_0$.

@wittemeier used Sicegar to estimate molar carbon assimilation. They used Sicegar's estimation of maximum slope in sigmoidal curves to understand maximum assimilation rate, and $t_1$ in sigmoidal curves to extract the point at which maximum assimilation is reached. (this is important because they extracted parameter estimations and thats what we improved)

@rajarathinam also used Sicegar to analyze carbon assimilation, and to extract estimations of maximum slope.
